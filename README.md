# RLinPortfolioOptimization
This was a past project which was used for my graduation paper, I have to rebuild it.

I made this two years ago, in order to get results for my graduation paper, it is a comparison of the Markowitz model, which is used to optimize the portfolio weights,
against a RL algorithm which tries to predict the up and down movements for the portfolio. I will rebuild it, and probably rewrite it in english soon.
